## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud API key
2. SportMonks API key
3. Node.js and npm/yarn installed

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in both the backend and frontend directories:

```env
# Backend .env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
SPORTMONKS_API_KEY=your_sportmonks_api_key

# Frontend .env
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

3. Start the frontend:
```bash
cd ../app
yarn install
yarn start
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Map Interaction**:
   - User clicks a point on the map
   - System captures latitude and longitude

2. **Location Processing**:
   - Backend uses Google Geocoding API to identify country and region
   - Queries database for teams in the specified area

3. **Team Selection**:
   - Shows 3 closest teams in the region
   - If fewer than 3 teams in region, finds next closest teams

4. **Match History**:
   - After selecting two teams, retrieves match history via SportMonks API
   - Displays detailed comparison and statistics

## 💻 Technologies

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - React Google Maps
  - Modern UI/UX design

- **Backend**:
